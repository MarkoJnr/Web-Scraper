## Web Scraping Tutorial
This tutorial was created using Python 3 and the BeautifulSoup library. 

It demonstrates how to web scrape links and headers from a website in a step-by-step format.

## Dependencies
This tutorial requires the following Python libraries:

**requests**
**BeautifulSoup**

You can install these libraries using pip. Simply run the following command:

**pip install requests beautifulsoup4**

## Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, open your preferred text editor or Python interpreter and create a new Python file.

Copy and paste the code provided in the tutorial into your file. Make sure to save your file with a .py extension.

## How it Works

The tutorial begins by using the requests library to send a GET request to a website URL. The HTML content of the website is then retrieved and stored in a variable.

Next, the BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML content and extract the links and headers from the website.

Finally, the extracted data is saved to a CSV file using the csv library.

## How to Use
To use this tutorial, simply run the Python file in your preferred Python interpreter. 

The links and headers of the website will be printed to the console and saved to a CSV file in the same directory as your Python file.

By default, the script extracts all links from the URL 'https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/' and saves them to a CSV file named 'links.csv'. 

If you want to scrape a different URL or save the links to a different file name, modify the url and with open('links.csv', 'w') as file lines in the script accordingly.

## Notes
I created a tutorial on web scraping by adding extra comments to my code. My goal was to provide a step-by-step guide that would make it easy for readers to understand how to scrape links and headers from a website. By being concise and clear in my explanations, I aimed to create a tutorial that would be accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.
